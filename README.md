# Airbnb Clone Project

## About the Project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

## Technology Stack
### Django
A high-level Python web framework for building RESTful APIs and handling backend logic.

### PostgreSQL
A powerful, open-source relational database system for storing and managing application data.

### GraphQL
A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need.

### Docker
A platform for containerizing applications, ensuring consistency across development and production environments.

### GitHub Actions
A CI/CD tool for automating workflows, including testing and deployment.

## Team Roles
### Backend Developer
Responsible for developing and maintaining the server-side logic, APIs, and database interactions.

### Database Administrator
Designs, implements, and maintains the database schema and ensures data integrity and performance.

### DevOps Engineer
Sets up and manages the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring smooth deployment and integration processes.

### Security Engineer
Implements and monitors security measures to protect the application and user data.

## Database Design
### Users
- **Fields:** `id`, `username`, `email`, `password`, `created_at`
- **Relationships:** A user can have multiple properties and bookings.

### Properties
- **Fields:** `id`, `title`, `description`, `price`, `location`, `owner_id`
- **Relationships:** A property belongs to a user and can have multiple bookings and reviews.

### Bookings
- **Fields:** `id`, `property_id`, `user_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `total_price`
- **Relationships:** A booking belongs to a user and a property.

### Reviews
- **Fields:** `id`, `property_id`, `user_id`, `rating`, `comment`, `created_at`
- **Relationships:** A review belongs to a user and a property.

### Payments
- **Fields:** `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `status`, `created_at`
- **Relationships:** A payment belongs to a booking.

## Feature Breakdown
### User Management
Allows users to register, login, and manage their profiles. Essential for personalizing the user experience.

### Property Management
Enables property owners to list, update, and manage their properties. Core to the platform's functionality.

### Booking System
Facilitates property bookings, including date selection and payment processing. Key to the platform's revenue model.

### Review System
Allows users to leave reviews and ratings for properties. Enhances trust and community engagement.

### Payment Processing
Handles secure transactions for bookings. Critical for monetization and user trust.

## API Security
### Authentication
Ensures that only authorized users can access certain endpoints. Protects user data and prevents unauthorized actions.

### Authorization
Controls what actions users can perform based on their roles. Prevents privilege escalation.

### Rate Limiting
Restricts the number of API calls a user can make in a given time frame. Prevents abuse and DDoS attacks.

### Data Validation
Ensures that only valid data is processed by the API. Prevents injection attacks and data corruption.
